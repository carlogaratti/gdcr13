                                          Good code matters
                                          

I have seen too much ugly code make too much money to believe that quality of code is either necessary or sufficient for commercial success or widespread use. 

However, I still believe that quality of code matters. 

Businesses that are able to develop and release with confidence, shift direction in response to opportunities and
competition, and maintain positive morale through challenges and setbacks will tend to be more successful than businesses with shoddy, buggy code.


Even if there was no long-term economic impact from careful coding I would still choose to write the best code I could. 
A seventy-year lifespan contains just over two billion seconds. That’s not enough seconds to waste on work I’m not
proud of. Coding well is satisfying, both the act itself and the knowledge that others will be able to understand, appreciate, use, and extend my work.
